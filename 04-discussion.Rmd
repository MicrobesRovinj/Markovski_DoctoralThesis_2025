# DISCUSSION

Studies on the temporal dynamics of microbial communities in seagrass sediments are rare [@Bourque2015; @Garcia-Martinez2009; @Smith2004], so there is a lack of knowledge on the response of these communities to ecological events, such as the decline of seagrass meadows. Consequently, there were no previously available data on the response of sediment microbes to the decline of seagrass meadows of the species *Cymodocea nodosa*, nor a comprehensive characterisation of the sediment microbial community associated with this seagrass species living outside the rhizosphere [@Cucio2016]. The present doctoral thesis, composed by studying sediment microbes during the decline and loss of a *C. nodosa* meadow in the Bay of Saline, on the eastern coast of the northern Adriatic Sea from July 2017 to October 2018, represents a unique contribution to the understanding of the response of these microbes to such an ecological event. The assessment of the status of the *C. nodosa* seagrass meadow and the environmental conditions in the sediment together with the determination of the community composition and the metabolic profile of the microbial communities in the sediment allowed a comprehensive assessment of the influence of seagrass decline on the microbes in the sediment. In addition, the evaluation of the same parameters in the upper 8 \si{\cm} of the surface sediment at the site with and without seagrass vegetation enabled the assessment of the changes associated with sediment depth and the influence of seagrass cover on the microbes in the sediment.

## Loss of the seagrass meadow

Part of the seafloor in the Bay of Saline was originally covered with a large *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow extending from the south-western coastal area at a depth of 1.5 \si{m} to the central part of the bay at a depth of 4 \si{m}. However, by the end of 2018 only a few patches were still present in the form of tiny strips along the shoreline. The biometric analysis of the seagrass showed an increase in shoot biomass and density from July until October 2017, when maximum values were reached. In November 2017, a sharp decline in these biometric indices was observed, followed by a further decline that continued in spring and summer 2018. In September and October 2018, no more seagrass leaves or shoots were found. The biomass of roots and rhizomes also peaked in October 2017, but unlike shoots, it lasted longer and remained stable until March 2018, when it began to decline until the end of the study. The maximum biometric values observed in October 2018 could be related to the unimodal growth pattern of this seagrass species. Indeed, *C. nodosa* shows a biomass maximum in summer, a minimum in winter, and a particularly active growth phase in spring [@Agostini2003; @Cancemi2002; @Najdek2020a; @Terrados1992; @Zavodnik1998]. The shift of the biomass maximum from summer to early autumn could be due to the increased activity of grazers in July and August 2017, as visibly grazed leaves were observed during this period [@Cebrian1996; @Heck2006; @Valentine2006]. The sharp decline in the biometric indices of the shoots in November 2017 is consistent with the growth pattern of this seagrass species and its reduced growth in winter [@Agostini2003; @Cancemi2002; @Najdek2020a; @Terrados1992; @Zavodnik1998]. However, the active growth and recovery of the seagrass in spring 2018 did not take place, which initially led to the loss of seagrass shoots and leaves and subsequently of roots and rhizomes.

The loss of the seagrass meadow was most likely triggered in spring 2018 by the increased turbidity of the seawater, which was a result of the intensified terrigenous input and sediment resuspension. The increased terrigenous input was, in turn, indicated by a decrease in salinity and an increase in the concentration of particulate matter in the seawater. Consequently, the increased turbidity reduced the availability of light to the seagrass and impaired its photosynthesis. Reduced photosynthetic activity can be detrimental to seagrass as it impairs the plant's ability to cope with the high concentration of hydrogen sulphide (\ch{H2S}) in the sediment [@Duarte2005]. Hydrogen sulphide inhibits cytochrome *c* oxidase [@Nicholls2013] and has therefore been identified as a potent phytotoxin [@Holmer2001a; @Koch2001]. The reoxidation of hydrogen sulphide back to sulphate using oxygen diffusing from seagrass roots has been recognised as a coping mechanism of seagrasses against hydrogen sulphide toxicity [@Duarte2005; @Hasler-Sheetal2015; @Holmer2005; @Pedersen2004]. Internal oxygen stress and hydrogen sulphide toxicity have indeed been linked to die-off events of seagrass meadows [@Borum2005; @Carlson1994]. The importance of hydrogen sulphide is also emphasised by the increase in its concentration and the expansion of its accumulation zone observed during the decline of the meadow in spring and summer 2018. This trend ended in August 2018, when extremely high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide were detected throughout the sediment core. It is therefore not surprising that seagrasses, which are often found in sediments with high sulphide concentrations, have one of the highest light requirements among plants, in order to supply their roots and rhizomes with oxygen and to maintain a considerable amount of non-photosynthetic tissue [@Dennison1993; @Duarte2005; @Orth2006]. Therefore, it is once again needed to emphasise that seagrasses are very sensitive to environmental changes, especially those that disrupt light availability, such as sediment load, eutrophication, and epiphyte cover of seagrass leaves [@Brodersen2015; @Costa2015; @Halun2002; @Terrados1998].

## Changes associated with sediment depth {#section-sediment-depth}

In order to study the sediment microbial communities in the Bay of Saline, their composition and metabolism were evaluated. The microbial community composition was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, while the communities metabolism was assessed by determining their metabolic profile using metaproteomics. The microbial community structure, based on bioinformatic analysis of the sequences of the V4 region, revealed that the microbial communities in the sediment were primarily stratified by sediment depth, as suggested by the visual appearance of some sediment cores (Figure \@ref(fig:sediment-cores-2017-09-14)), and secondarily differed between the seagrass-vegetated and nonvegetated site. Although the community richness estimators (Chao1 and ACE) showed no differences in relation to sediment depth at both sites, the diversity indices (exponential of the Shannon diversity index and Inverse Simpson) revealed a pattern in relation to sediment depth at the vegetated site, with the highest values observed in the first centimetre of sediment and the lowest in the deepest layer (7â€“8 \si{\cm}). Diversity indices account for both richness and evenness and are less sensitive to rare taxa than richness estimators, suggesting that rare taxa did not play a key role in the observed changes in alpha diversity associated with sediment depth [@Bent2008]. This observed change in diversity indices is consistent with previous studies that have described a decrease in alpha diversity from the sediment surface to deeper sediment layers, even at small scales such as within the first few metres [@Hoshino2020; @Petro2017]. The cause of the observed changes in alpha diversity associated with sediment depth in the seagrass-vegetated sediment could be the stabilisation of the sediment by the meadow [@Terrados2000; @vanKatwijk2010], the increase in organic matter content in the sediment by the seagrass due to the decay of dead tissue [@Duarte2005; @Peduzzi1991; @Liu2017; @Trevathan-Tackett2020], and the creation of specific environmental conditions around roots and rhizomes that can act as a filter when microbial cells are buried, promoting the separation of different layers [@Kirkpatrick2019; @Marshall2019; @Petro2017]. In contrast, the stability of alpha diversity throughout the nonvegetated sediment core may be due to the absence or reduced influence of these processes.

(ref:sediment-cores-2017-09-14) Sediment cores sampled on 14 September 2017 in the Bay of Saline in the *Cymodocea nodosa* seagrass meadow (vegetated site; left) and in the adjacent area without seagrass vegetation (nonvegetated site; right). The black zone, which is indicative of the formation of iron sulphides, is visible in the sediment core sampled from the vegetated site (left). The length of the plastic core sampler is 15 \si{\cm}.

The taxonomic classification of the obtained partial 16S rRNA sequences showed the dominance of the domain *Bacteria* over the domain *Archaea*. The bacterial community consisted mainly of *Desulfobacterota*, *Gammaproteobacteria*, *Bacteroidota*, *Chloroflexi*, *Planctomycetota*, and *Campylobacterota*, while the archaeal community mainly comprised *Nanoarchaeota*, *Thermoplasmatota*, *Crenarchaeota*, and *Asgardarchaeota*. All of these taxa are typical of marine sediments [@Hoshino2020; @Sun2020; @Walsh2016a; @Zheng2019], with *Campylobacterota* being characteristic of the seagrass rhizosphere [@Ettinger2017; @Jensen2007]. The observed trend of the proportion of archaea increasing with sediment depth and the proportion of bacteria decreasing is similar to trends observed for deeper sediment cores, which show a dominance of bacteria in the upper sediment parts and a similar proportion of bacteria and archaea in the deeper sediment [@Chen2017]. In addition to this general trend, the main taxa whose proportion changed with sediment depth were *Thermoplasmatota*, *Chloroflexi*, *Gammaproteobacteria*, and *Bacteroidota*. The increase in the proportion of *Thermoplasmatota* and *Chloroflexi* with sediment depth and the simultaneous decrease in the proportion of *Gammaproteobacteria* could be related to the measured general oxygen depletion after the first centimetre of sediment. Studies have associated Marine Benthic Group D and DHVEG-1, which make up the majority of *Thermoplasmatota* sequences in the sediment of the Bay of Saline, and *Chloroflexi* with anoxic sediments, while *Gammaproteobacteria* are more characteristic of oxic sediments [@Durbin2011; @Hoshino2020; @Lloyd2013]. In addition to oxygen depletion, the availability of fresh organic matter could also influence the changes in the proportion of microbial taxa with sediment depth. The ability of *Gammaproteobacteria* and *Bacteroidota* to degrade and assimilate fresh detritus in coastal sediments may have influenced the decline in their relative abundance with sediment depth, as it is known that fresh organic matter content is less available in deeper sediment layers [@Gihring2009; @Middelburg1989].

In contrast to the analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, which showed that the microbial communities in the sediment were primarily stratified by sediment depth and secondarily differed between the vegetated and nonvegetated site, the main factor influencing the microbial metabolic profile was the decline of the *C. nodosa* seagrass meadow. The influence of decline was observed in protein richness and diversity, the structure of the metabolic profile, and the assessed proteins involved in organic matter degradation. The influences of sediment depth or site were secondary; that is, the effects of seagrass meadow decline were not observed or were not of the same magnitude at each site and in every layer. Due to the primary influence of seagrass decline, the effect of sediment depth on the microbial metabolic profile is discussed in detail below in Section \@ref(section-temporal-differences), where the effects of seagrass decline are considered.

## Site differences: influence of seagrass cover {#section-site-differences}

Sampling sediment cores from two sites, one with a declining *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow (vegetated site) and the other without seagrass vegetation (nonvegetated site), made it possible to assess the influence of seagrass cover on the microbes in the sediment. As previously mentioned, the analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the microbial communities in the sediment showed differences between the vegetated and nonvegetated site. These differences were also suggested on some sampling dates by the distinct visual appearance of the sediment cores from the vegetated and nonvegetated site as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sediment-cores-2017-09-14). Changes in alpha diversity with sediment depth were only observed in the vegetated sediment. As these differences between sites are related to sediment depth, they are discussed in detail in Section \@ref(section-sediment-depth) when the changes with sediment depth are considered. The observed differences in microbial communities between sites are not surprising, as it is known that communities in marine sediments are site-specific [@Hamdan2013; @Polymenakou2005], which may only be more pronounced if one of the sites is influenced by seagrass cover. Indeed, data have shown that microbial communities in the sediment differ not only between areas with and without vegetation [@Alsaffar2020; @Smith2004; @Sun2020; @Zheng2019], but also between the periphery and the central region of the seagrass meadow [@Ettinger2017]. Although the communities from the vegetated and nonvegetated sediment showed differences, there was still a high degree of overlap in community composition. The highest degree of overlap was observed in the top sediment layer. These observations are not surprising as the microbes living in these sediments likely originate from the same source and only undergo site-specific selection through burial [@Hamdan2013; @Petro2019; @Walsh2016a]. In addition, the observed highest degree of overlap in community composition in the top sediment layer could be due not only to the same source of origin of the microbes, but also to the same carbon source, as seagrass detritus is one of the main carbon sources in *C. nodosa* meadows and can be imported into the nonvegetated site [@Holmer2004].

Taxonomic analysis of the partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained revealed differences between the vegetated and nonvegetated sites for some groups. *Crenarchaeota* and *Gammaproteobacteria* showed a higher proportion in the sediment of the nonvegetated site, while the proportion of *Bacteroidota* and *Campylobacterota* was higher in the vegetated sediment. Interestingly, different groups within the *Desulfobacterota* showed different affinities, with *Desulfosarcinaceae* showing a higher proportion in the vegetated sediment and *Desulfobulbaceae* in the nonvegetated sediment. The differences in proportions observed for *Crenarchaeota* between sites were the result of the much greater increase in *Bathyarcheia*, the major component of *Crenarchaeota* in the Bay of Saline, with increasing sediment depth at the nonvegetated site. *Bathyarcheia*, formerly known as the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group (MCG), are well adapted to energy limitation and are usually found in deeper sediment layers [@Kubo2012]. It is possible that the presence of *C. nodosa* has caused the observed lower proportion of this group in the vegetated sediment, as seagrasses enrich the sediment with organic matter directly or through various seagrass-mediated processes [@Duarte2005; @Liu2017; @Peduzzi1991; @vanKatwijk2010; @Terrados2000; @Trevathan-Tackett2020]. The higher proportion of *Gammaproteobacteria* in the nonvegetated sediment could, like its higher proportion in the top sediment layer [@Durbin2011; @Hoshino2020], be related to oxygen availability, as oxygen penetration depth was generally higher in the nonvegetated sediment. Indeed, @Ettinger2017 also found a higher proportion of *Gammaproteobacteria* in the sediment outside the seagrass meadow than inside it. *Thioalkalispiraceae*, one of the main groups within the *Gammaproteobacteria*, showed a strong difference in proportion between sites. The higher proportion of this group in the nonvegetated sediment could be related to the lower organic matter content in this sediment, as *Thioalkalispiraceae* are known to be chemolithoautotrophic [@Mori2011; @Mori2014] and may rely on inorganic compounds rather than the organic matter provided by the seagrass.

In contrast to the proportion of *Crenarchaeota* and *Gammaproteobacteria*, the proportion of *Bacteroidota* and *Campylobacterota* was higher in the vegetated sediment. The higher proportion of *Bacteroidota* in the sediment of the vegetated site could be related to the higher content of plant material in this sediment. Members of *Bacteroidota* have been identified as decomposers of macromolecules such as cellulose [@Thomas2011], and similar to angiosperm land plants, cellulose is the main component of seagrass cell walls [@Pfeifer2020; @Syed2016; @Torbatinejad2001]. The higher proportion of *Campylobacterota* in the vegetated sediment is not surprising, as this group and especially members of its family *Sulfurimonadaceae* are known to be closely associated with seagrass roots and rhizomes [@Jensen2007; @Ettinger2017]. In the Bay of Saline, the *Sulfurimonadaceae* also accounted for a high proportion of the sequences classified as *Campylobacterota* in the vegetated sediment. The proximity of the sampled sediment to seagrass roots and rhizomes probably influenced the higher proportion of *Campylobacterota* and consequently of *Sulfurimonadaceae* in the vegetated sediment. Since seagrasses are known to select the microbial community in the rhizosphere from the bulk sediment by enriching some taxa and depleting others [@Cucio2016; @Zhang2020; @Zhang2022], it is possible that seagrass roots and rhizomes alter the microbial community composition in the nearby sediment to some extent in a similar manner.

In general, *Desulfobacterota* was the most abundant high-taxonomic rank in the sediment microbial community in the Bay of Saline. This is consistent with other studies that have identified *Desulfobacterota* as one of the major high-taxonomic ranks in the sediment colonised by seagrass [@Cucio2016; @Garcia-Martinez2009; @Ettinger2017]. Although the proportion of *Desulfobacterota* did not show strong differences between sites or with increasing sediment depth, some groups within this phylum showed a different affinity for vegetated and nonvegetated sediment, as previously mentioned. The observed higher proportion of *Desulfosarcinaceae* in the vegetated sediment and *Desulfobulbaceae* in the nonvegetated sediment is consistent with previous studies that reported a high proportion of *Desulfosarcina*-related sequences in seagrass-vegetated sediments and a higher number of sequences related to *Desulfobulbaceae* in the nonvegetated sediment [@Garcia-Martinez2009; @Smith2004]. In addition, the high metabolic versatility of *Desulfosarcinaceae* [@Watanabe2020] may have led to their greater proliferation in vegetated sediment, where high concentrations of various carbon substrates may become available during organic matter decomposition [@Duarte2005; @Liu2017; @Peduzzi1991; @Trevathan-Tackett2020].

As already mentioned (Section \@ref(section-sediment-depth)), the main factor influencing the metabolic profile of the microbial communities in the sediment was the decline of the *C. nodosa* meadow, while the influence of sediment depth and site were secondary. The influence of site and thus of seagrass cover was particularly evident before the decline of seagrass, especially in the deeper sediment layers. This effect was observed in protein richness and diversity, the structure of the metabolic profile, and the assessed proteins involved in organic matter degradation. Due to the primary influence of seagrass decline, the effect of the sampling site on the metabolic profile of the microbial communities in the sediment is discussed in detail in Section \@ref(section-temporal-differences), where the effects of seagrass decline are considered.

## Temporal differences: influence of seagrass decline {#section-temporal-differences}

The analysis of a comprehensive set of 118 metaproteomes, whose proteins were identified by searching a database composed of the sequenced metagenomes, made it possible to assess the dynamics of the metabolic profile of the microbial sediment communities in the Bay of Saline. In addition, the sampling of sediment cores in the period before and during the decline of a *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow allowed the assessment of the temporal dynamics and thus the influence of seagrass decline on the same metabolic profile. The influence of the decline of the meadow was observed in protein richness and diversity, the structure of the metabolic profile, and the assessed proteins involved in organic matter degradation. Prior to the decline, higher values of the number of observed proteins and the exponential of the Shannon diversity index were found in the vegetated sediment compared to the nonvegetated sediment. Moreover, these differences were more pronounced in the deeper parts of the sediments, i.e. in the lower middle and bottom layer (Figure \@ref(fig:influence-seagrass-decline)). The differences between the sites began to disappear during the decline of the meadow and the values of the number of observed proteins and the exponential of the Shannon diversity index were similar to those found in the sediment previously inhabited by the meadow. In addition to these differences, the structure of the metabolic profile of the sediment communities of the nonvegetated site also showed temporal differences. A separation was found between the period before and during the decline of the meadow, especially in the deeper parts of the sediment and when only proteins belonging to the Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COG) category C, which includes proteins for energy production and conversion, were considered. In contrast, no temporal pattern was found for the communities of the vegetated site (Figure \@ref(fig:influence-seagrass-decline)).

(ref:influence-seagrass-decline) A conceptual diagram illustrating the shift in the metabolic profile (green dots) of sediment microbial communities during the decline of a *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow in the Bay of Saline. Prior to the decline (upper panel), differences in metabolic profiles were observed between the vegetated and nonvegetated site, particularly in the deeper sediment layers. During the decline (lower panel), these differences diminished and the metabolic profile of the nonvegetated site began to resemble that of the vegetated site. The analysis was based on sediment cores cut into four sections of 1 \si{\cm} length each: the top (0â€“1 \si{\cm}), the bottom (7â€“8 \si{\cm}), and two middle sections: upper middle (2â€“3 \si{\cm}) and lower middle (3â€“6 \si{\cm}).

Differences between sites discussed in Section \@ref(section-site-differences) were accompanied by differences in metabolic profiles between sites observed prior to decline of the meadow. This is not surprising, as data have shown that microbial communities in vegetated sediments differ in composition [@Alsaffar2020; @Ettinger2017; @Sun2020; @Zheng2019] and function [@Mohapatra2022] from communities in nonvegetated sediments. The higher protein richness and diversity observed at the vegetated site prior to meadow decline is consistent with other studies reporting higher metabolic diversity and microbial activity in sediments colonised by seagrasses, which may be related to the higher organic matter content in these sediments [@Duarte2005; @Holmer1997; @Mohapatra2022; @Smith2004]. Furthermore, the greater differentiation in protein richness and diversity between sites over the same time period in the deeper parts of the sediment is consistent with the previously discussed results showing greater separation in community composition between sites in these parts of the sediment. In contrast, the lack of such differentiation of the same parameters in the upper parts of the sediment, i.e. in the top and upper middle layer, could be explained by the input of seagrass-derived organic matter into the nonvegetated site, as organic matter from the *C. nodosa* meadow can be imported into the nonvegetated site and has been shown to be an important source for the prokaryotes living in this sediment [@Holmer2004]. These observations are also supported by the dynamics of the structure of the metabolic profile observed at the nonvegetated site, which showed that samples originating from the upper parts of the sediment were grouped together regardless of the period of sampling.

The lack of differences in protein richness and diversity between sites during the decline of the meadow suggests a more uniform metabolic profile of the microbial communities in the sediment during this period, similar to the metabolic profile of the communities of the vegetated site prior to the decline. Furthermore, this observation is supported by the dynamics of the structure of the metabolic profile observed at the nonvegetated site. Samples collected during the decline grouped with samples collected in the upper parts of the sediment before the decline. As seagrass meadows are known to stabilise the sediment by reducing its resuspension and mixing [@Duarte2005; @vanKatwijk2010; @Terrados2000], the lack of differentiation between sites during the decline of the meadow could be the result of a greater input of fresh organic matter into the nonvegetated sediment due to increased resuspension, mixing, and transport between sites when the meadow is no longer present. Indeed, during the decline of the meadow from May to August 2018, higher concentrations of total lipids and organic matter were detected at the nonvegetated than at the vegetated site. In contrast, the uniformity of the microbial profile observed at the vegetated site throughout the study period could be the result of maintaining the source of organic matter during the decline due to decay of leaves, roots, and rhizomes [@Duarte2005; @Peduzzi1991; @Liu2017; @Trevathan-Tackett2020].

Given the great importance of sediments colonised by seagrasses for carbon sequestration and the role of microbial communities in these habitats in the mineralisation of organic matter [@Duarte2005a; @Duarte2013; @Kennedy2010], it is interesting to evaluate the dynamics of microbial proteins involved in the degradation of organic matter during such an ecological event as the decline of a seagrass meadow. In addition, analysis of the functional COG categories showed that category C, which includes proteins for energy production and conversion, is the most abundant. This is consistent with metagenomic studies, which also found that energy production and conversion is one of the most abundant functional COG categories in coastal sediments [@Habibi2023]. Proteins involved in organic matter degradation were assessed by analysing the dynamics of hydrolytic enzymes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, fermentation-mediating enzymes, and proteins involved in dissimilatory sulphate reduction. The analysis of hydrolytic enzymes showed that Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes) and peptidases were more abundant than lipases, indicating the importance of carbohydrates and proteins as sources of organic matter for the microbes in the sediment of the Bay of Saline. Among the CAZymes, the glycoside hydrolase families GH5 and GH9, which contain members that can hydrolyse plant organic matter such as cellulose, were the most abundant [@Aspeborg2012; @Berlemont2016; @Drula2022]. This is not surprising since, as already mentioned, cellulose is the main component of the cell walls of seagrasses [@Pfeifer2020; @Syed2016; @Torbatinejad2001]. The peptidases consisted almost exclusively of metalloendopeptidases and serine endopeptidases, similar to other coastal sediments where high proportions of these enzymes were found among the extracellular proteases [@Liu2023; @Zhang2015a; @Zhou2013]. In general, CAZymes and peptidases showed no response to meadow decline, except that the proportion of CAZymes in the top sediment layer of the nonvegetated site decreased from pre-decline to meadow decline, while the proportion of peptidases in the upper middle sediment layer of the vegetated site increased during the same period. These patterns could be explained by the increased microbial colonisation of detritus and microbial utilisation of exogenous nitrogen during seagrass tissue decomposition, as studies have shown that the molar carbon:nitrogen content in seagrass litter decreases during this process [@Liu2017; @Peduzzi1991].

Prokaryotes utilise various transport proteins, including ABC transporters [@Davidson2004], to import hydrolytic products into the cell. The proportion of ABC transporters found in the sediment of the Bay of Saline is consistent with other studies that have also found a high abundance of these transporters in marine sediments [@Habibi2023; @Wang2020a]. Among the ABC transporters, those for sugars and amino acids were the most abundant and their dynamics reflected the overall dynamics of the metabolic profile. Before the decline of the meadow, ABC transporters for sugars showed a higher proportion in the deeper parts of the vegetated sediment than in the nonvegetated sediment. This distribution pattern reflects the higher organic matter content and thus the greater demand for ABC transporters in vegetated sediments [@Duarte2005; @Mohapatra2022]. In contrast, these ABC transporters did not show different proportions between sites during the decline of the meadow. In addition, the ABC transporters for sugars and amino acids showed an increase in their proportion in the bottom sediment layer at the nonvegetated site from before the decline to the decline of the meadow, which could be the result of a greater input of fresh organic matter into the nonvegetated sediment during the decline [@Duarte2005; @vanKatwijk2010; @Terrados2000], as previously mentioned.

The organic matter in anoxic sediments is mineralised in an anaerobic food chain in which fermentation processes carried out by microbes are an essential component [@Arndt2013]. Among the fermentation-mediating enzymes analysed, formate dehydrogenase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were the most abundant. This is not surprising, as microcosm studies of the anaerobic degradation of organic matter in marine sediments have found acetate, formate, and ethanol to be the most common fermentation products [@Graue2012; @Pelikan2021], while direct measurements of sediment pore water have demonstrated the presence of methanol and ethanol [@Zhuang2014]. In addition, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been reported to be important fermentation-mediating enzymes in Baltic Sea sediments [@Zinke2019]. Similar to the dynamics of the ABC transporters, the dynamics of the fermentation-mediating enzymes also reflected the overall changes of the metabolic profile. Prior to the decline of the meadow, the proportion of formate dehydrogenase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and alcohol dehydrogenase was found to be higher in the deeper parts of the sediment at the vegetated site than at the nonvegetated site, reflecting the higher organic matter content and possibly a higher fermentation rate in the seagrass-colonised sediments [@Duarte2005; @Mohapatra2022].

Given that dissimilatory sulphate reduction is recognised as the predominant terminal pathway of organic matter mineralisation in anoxic seabeds [@Jorgensen1982; @Jorgensen2019], that *Desulfobacterota*, a group known to contain sulphate reducers found in marine sediments, was the most abundant high-taxonomic rank in the sediment microbial community in the Bay of Saline, and that one of the most abundant proteins in the functional COG category C was adenylylsulphate reductase, a protein known to be involved in dissimilatory sulphate reduction, it is interesting to assess the dynamics of the enzymes involved in this process in more detail. The metaproteomes of the microbial community in the sediment of the Bay of Saline contained sulphate adenylyltransferase (Sat), adenylylsulphate reductase (Apr), and dissimilatory sulphite reductase (Dsr), enzymes involved in the dissimilatory sulphate reduction pathway and shared by known sulphate-reducing microbes [@Jorgensen2019]. These enzymes showed changes comparable to the dynamics of the overall metabolic profile. In general, the proportion of these enzymes was higher in the deeper parts of the sediment at the vegetated site than at the nonvegetated site before the decline of the meadow, while such differences were not observed during the decline. Similar to the dynamics of the overall metabolic profile, these observations could be explained by the higher organic matter content in the seagrass-colonised sediments before the decline [@Duarte2005; @Mohapatra2022] and by a greater input of fresh organic matter into the nonvegetated sediment during the decline [@Duarte2005; @vanKatwijk2010; @Terrados2000], as previously mentioned.

In contrast to all these observations of the dynamics of the microbial metabolic profile, the community composition determined by analysing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene showed no temporal dynamics and thus no influence of the decline of the seagrass meadow. Even when the composition was analysed in a way that excludes the previously established influence of sediment depth and sampling site, no grouping of communities by month, year, or the period before and during seagrass meadow decline could be observed. Such a stable community composition and, in contrast, a dynamic metabolic profile could be the result of a large amount of extracellular DNA or a large proportion of dormant or dead microbial cells in marine sediments [@Bradley2019; @Cangelosi2014; @Carini2016; @Jones2010; @Luna2002; @Torti2015; @Torti2018]. It is estimated that over 80\si{\percent} of DNA in marine sediments is extracellular [@DellAnno2002; @DellAnno2005]. Furthermore, dead cells can account for up to 70\si{\percent} of all bacterial cells in coastal marine sediments, while only 4\si{\percent} of living cells are actively growing [@Luna2002]. Molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing or metagenomics are usually based on the isolation of total DNA and therefore cannot distinguish whether the DNA originates from living, dead, active, or dormant cells or the extracellular DNA pool [@Cangelosi2014; @Torti2015]. In addition, the metabolic versatility of the microbes may contribute to some extent to the observed community stability, as the same community members may start to perform different metabolic functions during the decline of the seagrass meadow [@Bowen2011; @Louca2018]. Also, a longer sampling period after the loss of the seagrass meadow may be required to observe the changes in community composition, as the microbes living in marine sediments often have very long generation times [@Jorgensen2016; @Starnawski2017]. The inability of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to detect temporal changes in community composition highlights the importance of molecular techniques that enable functional characterisation, such as metaproteomics, in determining microbial response to environmental change in marine systems [@Saito2019].
