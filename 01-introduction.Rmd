# INTRODUCTION

Marine sediments cover approximately 70\si{\percent} of the Earth's surface. In these habitats, biomass is primarily constituted by microbes, mainly bacteria and archaea [@Nealson1997]. The estimated number of microbial cells in marine sediments ranges from 2.9 × 10^29^ to 5.4 × 10^29^ [@Kallmeyer2012; @Parkes2014]. This abundance is approximately equivalent to that found in seawater and soil [@Kallmeyer2012]. Microbial cells are ubiquitous in the sediments of all oceans [@Kallmeyer2012\; Figure \@ref(fig:kallmeyer2012)], extending from the sediment surface to several kilometres below the seafloor [@Inagaki2015]. Generally, the abundance of prokaryotes in the sediment decreases with increasing sediment depth and age [@Kallmeyer2012]. The diverse environmental conditions present in different sediments contribute to a great diversity of prokaryotic life in these habitats [@Zhang2019; @Hoshino2020; @Parkes2014; @Tapilatu2024; @Li2020a]. The primary factors influencing the composition of bacterial and archaeal communities in marine sediments are oxygen availability and sediment depth, both of which are influenced by varying sedimentation rates from the water column. These factors affect the formation of specific microbial communities, generally distinguishing deep-sea oxic sediment communities from more anoxic communities in coastal areas [@Orsi2018; @Hoshino2020]. Besides these general trends, other habitat-specific factors further contribute to the differentiation of communities in deep-sea and coastal sediments. For example, environments such as hydrothermal vents [@Cerqueira2018] and cold seeps [@Zhang2012a] in the deep sea, or seagrass meadows [@Duarte2005] in coastal sediments, exhibit unique characteristics that shape specific microbial community structures.

## Marine sediments: a habitat for microbes {#section-habitat}

Sedimentation of organic matter from the water column serves as the primary source of electron donors and thus energy for microbes in marine sediments [@Kallmeyer2012; @Orsi2018; @Jorgensen2019]. This process is influenced by several factors, such as the productivity and depth of the overlying water column, as well as terrestrial input [@Berger1990; @Jahnke1996]. High sedimentation rates create anoxic sediments rich in organic matter [@Jorgensen1982; @Bowles2014], while low rates enable oxygen to penetrate deeper into the sediment [@DHondt2009; @Roy2012]. The sedimentation rate is closely linked to the productivity of the water column, which tends to be higher on the continental shelf compared to the open ocean [@Orsi2018]. Thus, anoxic conditions in continental shelf sediments develop close to the sediment surface [@Bowles2014], whereas in the open ocean, where both productivity and sedimentation rates are lower, oxygen-rich zones can extend up to 30 \si{\m} below the sediment surface [@Roy2012].

The composition of the microbial community varies greatly between oxic and anoxic sediments, reflecting the distinct environmental conditions present in these two types of habitats [@Orsi2018; @Hoshino2020]. In oxic sediments, microbial growth is typically limited by the availability of organic matter. In contrast, microbes in anoxic sediments are primarily regulated by the concentrations of terminal electron acceptors, most commonly sulphate. The abundance of microbial cells is markedly greater in anoxic sediments than in their oxic counterparts, with differences reaching up to eight orders of magnitude [@Kallmeyer2012; @Jorgensen2016]. For instance, in coastal anoxic mud, microbial cell counts can be as high as 10^10^ \si{\cellsPerCubiccm}, whereas oxic clay found in deep-sea regions, which is poor in organic matter, averages only about 10^2^ \si{\cellsPerCubiccm} [@Jorgensen2016]. Global analyses indicate that in oxic sediments, cell abundance drops below 10^7^ \si{\cellsPerg} just 0.1 \si{\m} beneath the seafloor. In contrast, even at 1 \si{\m} beneath the seafloor in anoxic sediments, the typical concentration of cells ranges from 10^7^ to 10^9^ \si{\cellsPerg} [@Kallmeyer2012; @Orsi2018]. The highest microbial abundances have been recorded in the shallow, eutrophic regions of the Baltic Sea, while the central areas of the North and South Pacific Ocean gyres exhibit some of the lowest abundances [@Jorgensen2016]. Here, at sediment depths greater than 20 \si{\m}, microbial counts fall below measurable levels [@DHondt2009; @DHondt2015; @Roy2012]. The exceptionally low abundances observed in deep-sea sediments of the great ocean gyres are attributed to extremely low sedimentation rates. These rates allow deep oxygen penetration and extensive mineralisation of organic matter prior to deeper burial [@DHondt2009; @DHondt2015; @Orsi2018].

\newpage
Sediments present a challenging environment for microbial survival due to marked changes in environmental conditions throughout the sediment core. Nevertheless, diverse prokaryotic communities have been identified from the sediment surface down to depths of approximately 2.5 \si{\km} [@Inagaki2015]. The vertical structure of the sediment core reflects the sedimentation of fresh material from the water column to the seabed and its burial over time [@Orsi2018; @Petro2017]. Microbial cells from the water column or the seabed surface are buried alongside this material, gradually becoming separated from the sediment surface while being subjected to changing environmental conditions [@Petro2017]. As sediment age and depth increase, microbes encounter an important challenge: the reduction of available organic matter [@Jorgensen2016; @Petro2017]. More labile organic compounds are depleted in shallower sediment layers, leading to impoverished organic matter in older and deeper sediments [@Petro2017; @Jorgensen2016; @Middelburg1989]. Consequently, the composition of organic matter shifts towards a higher content of refractory matter, which limits energy sources and results in slower microbial activity in deeper sediment layers [@Jorgensen2016; @Petro2017; @Orsi2018]. Studies have shown that microbial activity decreases by two to three orders of magnitude in sediment layers just a few meters deep compared to surface sediment [@Petro2017; @Roy2012]. Additionally, a corresponding decline in cell abundance and an increase in generation time has been observed at the same depth [@Kallmeyer2012; @Starnawski2017\; Figure \@ref(fig:starnawski2017)]. Microbial activity, cell abundance, and generation time can all be linked to sediment age and the declining availability of organic matter [@Petro2017; @Starnawski2017].

(ref:starnawski2017) The vertical biogeochemical zonation (A) and the corresponding distribution of microbial cell abundances (B) and generation times (C) in sediments. Biogeochemical zones: Top, surface sediment; SR, upper sulphate-rich sediment; SMT, sulphate–methane transition zone; MG, methanogenic sediment; Bottom, deep methanogenic zone. From @Starnawski2017.

The sediment column is characterised not only by a decline in the availability of organic matter but also by changes in biogeochemical zones as sediment depth increases [@Starnawski2017\; Figure \@ref(fig:starnawski2017)]. These changes are accompanied by variations in specific terminal electron acceptors, with each layer identified by the most energetically favourable and available acceptor of organic matter mineralisation [@Froelich1979; @Canfield1993; @Thamdrup1994]. Starting from the top, the biogeochemical zones include an oxic layer, where oxygen (\ch{O2}) serves as the terminal electron acceptor; a zone of nitrate (\ch{NO3-}) reduction; zones of manganese [\ch{Mn({IV})}] and iron [\ch{Fe({III})}] oxides reduction; a zone of sulphate (\ch{SO4^2-}) reduction; and the deepest methanogenic layer, where carbon dioxide (\ch{CO2}) is converted to methane [\ch{CH4}\; @Orcutt2011]. This biogeochemical stratification can be disrupted in the surface layer due to bioturbation [@Kristensen2001], typically extending to a depth of about 10 ± 5 \si{\cm} [@Petro2017; @Boudreau1998; @Meysman2006]. This activity generates a layer of considerable biogeochemical heterogeneity, allowing for localised deeper oxygen penetration [@Boudreau1998; @Meysman2006]. In addition, bioturbation allows for deeper transport of organic matter, which leads to increased microbial activity and dynamics in this layer [@Petro2017]. Beneath the bioturbation zone, environmental conditions stabilise, organic matter sources diminish, and diffusion becomes the primary process [@Jorgensen2016; @Petro2017]. Here, sulphate reduction is the main process of organic matter mineralisation [@Jorgensen1982; @Petro2017]. This layer is separated from the deeper methanogenic region by a narrow sulphate-methane transition (SMT) zone characterised by sulphate-dependent methane oxidation and by a peak in the sulphate reduction rate [@Thomsen2001; @Leloup2007; @Petro2017]. The deeper layers, lacking sulphate, primarily rely on methanogenesis for mineralisation [@Petro2017].

## Molecular techniques for studying sediment microbial communities

Traditionally, microbial communities were primarily described through cultivation techniques [@Amann1995]. However, it is now well established that less than 1\si{\percent} of microorganisms can be cultured in laboratory settings [@Jannasch1959; @Ferguson1984], a phenomenon preventing the accurate description of microbial populations known as the "great plate count anomaly" [@Amann1995; @Staley1985]. This discrepancy is attributed to factors such as the selective nature of culture media, the presence of inactive cells, and the aggregation of bacteria [@Jannasch1959]. To address the culture-dependent limitations, @Pace1986 pioneered molecular microbial ecology by cloning DNA extracted from environmental samples and by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. This innovative approach allowed for the identification of microorganisms without the need for cultivation, enabling studies of microbial ecology based on the molecular phylogeny of the 16S rRNA gene [@Rappe2003; @Woese1977; @Woese1990]. As a result, many novel taxonomic groups were described [@Okabe2010]. The assessment of microbial communities in coastal marine sediments began with the study by @Gray1996, which reported the phylogenetic composition of a bacterial community within marine nearshore sediments. Nowadays, determining the structure of the microbial community typically involves extracting environmental DNA, amplifying a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing with various next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, usually the Illumina MiSeq platform [@Kozich2013; @Hoshino2020]. Although this methodological approach has revolutionised marine microbial ecology, focusing on a single gene or gene fragment allows for the estimation of only the microbial community composition and dynamics. To characterise the potential and active metabolic processes of microbes, a comprehensive identification and quantification of all present genes and their products is essential [@Zhang2010].

A commonly recommended approach to assess the potential metabolic processes carried out by microbes in the environment is metagenomics [@Heidelberg2010]. In contrast to traditional genomics, which focuses on the genomic DNA of a single organism, metagenomics explores the collective genomic information of all organisms present in a community [@Quince2017]. The typical metagenomic method used in studies is shotgun metagenomics, in which total DNA is isolated from the environmental sample and sequenced in an untargeted ("shotgun") approach using high-throughput sequencing techniques [@Heidelberg2010; @Quince2017]. Usually, total DNA is isolated from the environmental sample and used for metagenomic library preparation and sequencing [@Quince2017]. The nucleotide sequences obtained are then assembled into longer sequences, known as contigs, often using bioinformatic tools based on the de Bruijn graph [@Simpson2015; @Quince2017]. The assembled reads are then compared with existing databases for taxonomic classification and functional annotation [@Simon2011; @Quince2017]. An important advantage of this approach is that it eliminates potential biases associated with amplification of specific DNA fragments by PCR, such as limited primer coverage [@Apprill2015; @Parada2016; @Simon2011]. Indeed, direct sequencing of total DNA has been shown to be the most accurate method for determining taxonomic composition, even though it requires more resources for sequencing and computation [@vonMering2007; @Simon2011]. Metagenomics is now widely used to characterise microbial diversity and metabolic potential in both surface and deep sediments [@Moore2020; @Marshall2018]. However, to comprehensively study the processes carried out by microbial communities, it is essential to integrate other omics approaches that focus on gene products and active processes, such as metaproteomics.

@Wilmes2004 proposed the term "metaproteomics" to describe the large-scale characterisation of the entire protein composition of a microbial community at a given time. The methods used to identify these proteins are based on approaches originally developed for proteomic analyses [@VanDenBossche2025]. These methods typically involve enzymatic digestion of the isolated proteins, usually with trypsin, separation of the peptides using liquid chromatography, and peptide analysis by tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS\; @VanDenBossche2025; @Wang2014]. A suitable approach for the enzymatic digestion of proteins isolated from environmental samples is filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), which enables the removal of many contaminating compounds that are usually present in environments such as soils and sediments and are often isolated together with proteins [@Wisniewski2009; @VanDenBossche2025]. In the final bioinformatic analysis step, the peptide spectra are matched with theoretical spectra from protein sequence databases [@Saito2019; @VanDenBossche2025]. This process enables both the identification and quantification of peptides and their corresponding proteins [@VanDenBossche2025]. Determining the full spectrum of proteins produced by microbial communities poses a number of challenges, mainly due to the complexity of metaproteomes [@Wilmes2015]. For example, the wide range of abundance of proteins in a metaproteomic sample and the low coverage of protein sequence databases pose limitations to successful protein identification [@Wang2014; @Wilmes2015; @Saito2019]. Despite these obstacles, metaproteomics holds great promise in linking genetic potential to phenotype and thus improving our understanding of the processes carried out by microbial communities [@Wilmes2015]. In addition, metaproteomic techniques have been successfully applied in various types of marine sediments, e.g. cold seeps [@Stokke2012; @Glass2014], diffuse hydrothermal venting [@Urich2014], mudflat aquaculture [@Lin2015], and chronically petroleum-polluted [@Bargiela2015] sediments.

## Composition of sediment microbial communities {#section-composition}

Using the previously described molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a comprehensive overview of the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in marine sediments was obtained. Large differences were observed between oxic and anoxic sediments [@Hoshino2020\; Figure \@ref(fig:hoshino2020)], which could be related to the environmental differences that characterise these types of sediments (Section \@ref(section-habitat)). The data showed that the proportion of bacteria in marine sediments is generally higher than that of archaea and that the contribution of archaea is more pronounced in low-oxygen sediments than in those with higher oxygen content [@Hoshino2019; @Hoshino2020]. Within the archaeal community, the phyla *Asgardaeota* and *Crenarchaeota* characterise the anoxic sediments, while the phylum *Thaumarchaeota* dominates in oxic sediments [@Durbin2011; @Lauer2016; @Hoshino2020]. Furthermore, within the bacterial community, members of *Atribacteria*, *Chloroflexi*, and *Planctomycetes* are predominant in low-oxygen sediments, while *Alphaproteobacteria*, *Gammaproteobacteria*, and *Firmicutes* dominate in sediments with higher oxygen content [@Durbin2011; @Hoshino2020].

(ref:hoshino2020) Differences in taxonomic composition between microbial communities in oxic and anoxic marine sediments. The composition was determined using universal primers targeting both archaea and bacteria. The relative abundance of archaeal (ARC) and bacterial (BAC) sequences in each sample is represented by a red line, while sediment depth is shown on a logarithmic scale with a light blue line. Sampling expeditions are colour-coded above the corresponding bar. From @Hoshino2020.

In addition to the differences between oxic and anoxic sediments, major changes in microbial taxonomic composition and richness are generally observed with increasing sediment depth [@Walsh2016a; @Chen2017; @Petro2017; @Kirkpatrick2019; @Hoshino2020]. These changes could also be related to shifts in environmental conditions with increasing sediment depth, as in the case of differences between oxic and anoxic sediments (Section \@ref(section-habitat)). In general, bacteria dominate over archaea in surface sediments, while their abundance becomes similar with increasing sediment depth [@Chen2017]. The higher proportion of archaea in deeper sediments is probably related to their adaptability to limited sources of organic matter [@Hoehler2013]. Interestingly, differences in the change in archaeal and bacterial richness with increasing sediment depth were observed between oxic and anoxic sediments. In anoxic sediments, both bacterial and archaeal richness generally decrease with increasing sediment depth, whereas in oxic sediments, archaeal richness remains stable and only bacterial richness decreases [@Hoshino2020]. Members of *Gammaproteobacteria*, *Deltaproteobacteria* (reclassified as phylum *Desulfobacterota*), *Alphaproteobacteria*, *Acidobacteria*, and *Bacteroidetes* show higher proportions in surface sediments, while the subsurface is characterised by *Atribacteria*, *Chloroflexi*, and various archaeal groups such as *Bathyarchaeota* and *Lokiarchaeota* [@Walsh2016a; @Chen2017; @Petro2017; @Waite2020]. Interestingly, a clear shift in the taxonomic composition of the bacterial community was observed at a sediment depth of around 1 \si{\km} [@Inagaki2015]. The phyla *Chloroflexi* and *Atribacteria*, which are characteristic of subsurface sediments, become less present and groups known to dominate terrestrial soil habitats such as *Actinobacteria*, *Proteobacteria*, *Firmicutes*, *Bacteroidetes*, and *Acidobacteria* begin to dominate. These changes were explained by the preservation of indigenous bacteria in terrigenous sediments over tens of millions of years after burial in the seabed [@Inagaki2015].

## Metabolism of sediment microbial communities

The large differences in environmental conditions between oxic and anoxic sediments as well as throughout the sediment core (Section \@ref(section-habitat)) are reflected not only in the composition of the microbial communities (Section \@ref(section-composition)), but also in their metabolism [@Orsi2018]. The sedimentation of organic matter from the water column [@Kallmeyer2012; @Orsi2018; @Jorgensen2019] and the available terminal electron acceptors [@Froelich1979; @Canfield1993; @Thamdrup1994] are the main factors influencing the metabolism of these communities (Section \@ref(section-habitat)). Studies indicate that in oxic sediments, where organic matter is scarce and the oxygen zone can therefore extend very deep into the sediment, chemolithoautotrophic archaea (e.g. ammonia-oxidising members of the phylum *Thaumarchaeota*), the ubiquitous gammaproteobacterial JTB255 group, and members of the *Nitrospinae* and *Nitrospirae* perform dark carbon fixation [@Molari2013; @Bienhold2016; @Dyksma2016; @Tully2016; @Orsi2018]. Furthermore, it appears that ammonia in deep-sea sediments is remineralised from organic compounds by heterotrophic microbes and utilised by ammonia-oxidising *Thaumarchaeota*, highlighting the importance of interactions between different groups of microbes [@Wankel2015; @Tully2016; @Orsi2018]. The possibility that some members of *Thaumarchaeota* grow mixotrophically further complicates the understanding of the specific roles that each group plays in these habitats [@Qin2014].

In contrast to sediments with high oxygen content, anoxic marine sediments are rich in organic matter, which leads to oxygen consumption in the upper centimetres of the sediment [@Bowles2014; @Orsi2018\; Section \@ref(section-habitat); @Jorgensen2019]. Below this surface zone, anaerobic microbial metabolism, which relies on the remaining energetically most favourable terminal electron acceptors, is responsible for the mineralisation of organic matter [@Canfield1993; @Thamdrup1994\; Figure \@ref(fig:middelburg2009); @Middelburg2009; @Orsi2018; @Jorgensen2019]. Aerobic organisms can mineralise the organic matter completely to carbon dioxide via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In contrast, the organic matter in anoxic sediments is mineralised in an anaerobic food chain [@Arndt2013]. Degradation begins with the hydrolytic breakdown of high-molecular-weight organic matter such as carbohydrates and proteins by extracellular enzymes, which can be attached to the cell or released into solution [@Arnosti2011; @Jorgensen2019]. These complex polymers are converted into substrates that are small enough (typically less than ca. 600 \si{\dalton}, possibly higher for polysaccharides) to be transported across cell membranes [@Arnosti2011; @Reintjes2017; @Jorgensen2019]. This initial hydrolysis is often the rate-limiting step in the overall degradation of organic matter, emphasising its crucial role in controlling degradation efficiency [@Arndt2013; @Jorgensen2019]. Indeed, research suggests that subsequent mineralisation pathways do not strongly influence degradation rates [@Beulig2018].

include_graphics(path = "figures/middelburg2009.png")

```
(ref:middelburg2009) Conceptual model of the degradation of organic matter in marine sediments. High-molecular-weight organic matter is converted into smaller substrates by hydrolysis and fermentation. These products are respired with the most energetically favourable terminal electron acceptors in the following order of utilisation: oxygen (\ch{O2}), nitrate (\ch{NO3-}), manganese [\ch{Mn({IV})}] and iron [\ch{Fe({III})}] oxides, sulphate (\ch{SO4^2-}), and carbon dioxide (\ch{CO2}). Manganese [\ch{Mn({II})}], iron [\ch{Fe({II})}], sulphide (\ch{H2S + HS- + S^2-}), and methane (\ch{CH4}) are produced and can be oxidised after diffusing upwards. Modified from @Middelburg2009.

The microbial community in the sediment converts small substrates produced by hydrolytic processes such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, organic acids, etc. into a range of products such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g. formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate), alcohols, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide through multi-step fermentation processes [@Jorgensen2000; @Jorgensen2019]. *Planctomycetes*, *Anaerolineales* (phylum *Chloroflexi*), and *Bathyarchaeota* have been identified as initial fermenters in anoxic sediments, while *Dehalococcoidia* (phylum *Chloroflexi*), *Deltaproteobacteria* (reclassified as phylum *Desulfobacterota*), and *Nanoarchaeota* may be involved in secondary fermentation [@Suominen2021; @Waite2020]. Since sulphate-reducing microbes are generally unable to utilise the products of hydrolysis of complex organic matter, they take up the substrates produced by the fermenters and respire them to carbon dioxide using sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor [@Jorgensen2000; @Jorgensen2019]. The importance of sulphate reduction is reflected in the estimate that this process in coastal sediments could be responsible for 50\si{\percent} of the mineralisation of organic carbon in the sediment column [@Jorgensen1982; @Jorgensen2019]. The sulphate reducers found in marine sediments belong mainly to uncultured groups within the *Deltaproteobacteria* (reclassified as phylum *Desulfobacterota*), which are only distantly related to cultured sulphate reducers [@Jorgensen2019; @Waite2020]. When the sulphate is depleted, the terminal degradation of organic carbon is taken over by methanogenic archaea, whose substrate spectrum is narrower and largely limited to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and possibly acetate [@Jorgensen2000; @Petro2017; @Jorgensen2019]. Most of the methane produced in the continental shelf and slope sediments diffuses upwards into the SMT zone, where it is oxidised by the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), with sulphate serving as a terminal electron acceptor [@Egger2018; @Jorgensen2019].

## Seagrasses {#section-seagrasses}

Seagrasses are a polyphyletic group of monocotyledonous angiosperms adapted to a fully submerged lifestyle in marine waters [@Les1997; @Orth2006]. It is estimated that they evolved from their terrestrial ancestors around 70 to 100 million years ago [@Orth2006; @Wissler2011; @Capo-Bauca2022]. Colonisation of marine habitats is considered a difficult adaptive obstacle, requiring the acquisition of salinity tolerance, underwater vegetative growth, a sufficient anchoring system to withstand wave action and tidal currents, and hydrophilous (water-mediated) pollination [@Arber1920]. Indeed, seagrasses fulfil all four of these characteristics necessary for plants to thrive in the marine environment [@denHartog1970]. Moreover, the occurrence of three independent seagrass lineages (Hydrocharitaceae, Cymodoceaceae complex, and Zosteraceae) proves that the acquisition of these traits occurred multiple times and represents an impressive example of convergent evolution in angiosperms [@Les1997]. There are approximately 70 species regarded as seagrasses, all of which are classified in the order Alismatales [@Short2011; @Unsworth2022]. Within this order, three families consist exclusively of seagrasses, Zosteraceae (three genera), Cymodoceaceae (five genera), and Posidoniaceae (one genus), while the family Hydrocharitaceae contains three genera that are considered seagrasses and 14 genera that are restricted to freshwater habitats [@denHartog2006]. In addition to the species within these genera, many species of the genus *Ruppia* are sometimes considered seagrasses, while species of the genera *Potamogeton* and *Lepilaena* are considered associates of seagrasses or facultative members of the seagrass community [@Green2003].

Seagrasses occur in shallow marine and estuarine environments of all continents except Antarctica [@denHartog2006; @Green2003]. The areas containing the highest number of seagrass species are insular South-East Asia, including northern tropical Australia and the Great Barrier Reef, south-eastern India, eastern Africa, southern Japan, and south-western Australia [@Short2007; UNEP-WCMC and Short, -@UnitedNationsEnvironmentProgrammeWorldConservationMonitoringCentreUNEP-WCMC2018\; Figure \@ref(fig:westerveld2019)]. In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a unique temperate–tropical mix of seagrass species [@Short2007]. *Zostera marina* Linnaeus and *Nanozostera noltei* (Hornemann) Tomlinson et Posluszny, two species common in temperate regions, occur here alongside the endemic *Posidonia oceanica* (Linnaeus) Delile [@Green2003; @Short2007; @Guiry2025]. In addition to these species, the Mediterranean is also inhabited by *Halophila stipulacea* (Forsskål) Ascherson, an invasive species thought to have been introduced from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migration), and by *Cymodocea nodosa* (Ucria) Ascherson, a seagrass whose congeners inhabit the tropical Indo-Pacific [@Fritsch1895; @Green2003; @Guiry2025; @Short2007]. In addition, *Ruppia* spp. have been found in the Mediterranean Sea, but their distribution is generally restricted to shallow waters characterised by fine sediments and strong salinity fluctuations, such as coastal lagoons and brackish habitats [@Green2003; @Mannino2015]. These seagrass species, which are characteristic of the Mediterranean, have also been found in the Adriatic Sea [@Curiel2021; @Green2003; @Guidetti2002].

The seagrass *C. nodosa*, whose sediment microbes are the subject of this doctoral thesis, is, as already mentioned, widespread in the Mediterranean [@Green2003; @Short2007]. However, it is not restricted to this area. Its range also includes the Atlantic coast of Africa, including the Canary Islands. Here, the southern limit of distribution is south of the Tropic of Cancer [@denHartog1970; @Green2003; @Short2007]. On the European Atlantic coast, it is also found in Portugal, where it is mixed with temperate seagrasses [@Short2007], and in southern Spain [@denHartog1970]. In the Adriatic Sea, *C. nodosa* is common in both the northern [@Agostini2003; @Najdek2020a; @Orlando-Bonaca2015; @Smith2025; @Zavodnik1998] and southern [@denHartog1970; @Macic2014] parts of this area of the Mediterranean Sea. This seagrass is generally found in shallow waters, but can sometimes reach a depth of 30 to 40 \si{\m}. The meadows in shallow and deep waters are typically discontinuous [@Green2003]. *C. nodosa* is usually found in sheltered locations, such as bays and coastal lagoons [@Agostini2003; @Green2003; @Najdek2020a; @Orlando-Bonaca2015; @Smith2025; @Zavodnik1998]. In general, it is considered a pioneer species that often precedes *P. oceanica* in succession, with which it cannot compete [@denHartog1970; @Green2003]. The growth pattern is unimodal, with a biomass maximum in summer, a minimum in winter, and a particularly active growth phase in spring [@Agostini2003; @Cancemi2002; @Najdek2020a; @Terrados1992; @Zavodnik1998]. *C. nodosa* is a dioecious species [@Green2003; @denHartog1970]. Flowering has been described in spring and summer, while fruits have been collected from spring to late autumn [@denHartog1970; @Reyes1995].

(ref:waycott2009) Global assessment of seagrass loss in different coastal areas based on data from 215 sites. An increase or decrease in seagrass area at each site of more than 10\si{\percent} is marked in green and red, respectively. If the final area is within ±10\si{\percent} of the initial area, the change is considered undetectable and marked in yellow. From @Waycott2009.

Seagrasses are considered ecosystem engineers because they cause physical state changes in biotic and abiotic materials and thus modify, maintain, and create habitats [@Jones1994; @Orth2006]. These environments, known as seagrass meadows, are ecologically important because they provide habitat and food for many animals, serve as nursery areas for the larger ocean, attenuate wave energy, stabilise the sediment, and improve the transparency of the water by trapping sediment particles [@Duarte2002; @Green2003; @Heck2006]. In addition, the sediments of seagrass meadows are enriched with organic carbon through the trapping of organic particles from the water column, the release of dissolved organic carbon by seagrass roots, and the already mentioned stabilisation of the sediment [@Duarte2005; @vanKatwijk2010; @Terrados2000]. Moreover, the decomposition of seagrass leaves, roots, and rhizomes increases the availability of organic matter in seagrass meadows [@Liu2017; @Peduzzi1991; @Trevathan-Tackett2020]. It is therefore not surprising that the sediments of seagrass meadows are natural hotspots for carbon sequestration. It is estimated that these areas are responsible for up to 20\si{\percent} of global carbon sequestration in marine sediments, although they occupy only 0.1\si{\percent} of the seafloor [@Duarte2005a; @Duarte2013; @Kennedy2010]. Due to the importance of seagrass meadows, their observed loss on a global scale is worrying [@Dunic2021; @Orth2006]. The area covered by seagrass meadows has declined by 29\si{\percent} worldwide since the end of the 19th century [@Waycott2009\; Figure \@ref(fig:waycott2009)]. Although more recent estimates have reduced the global loss over the same period to 19\si{\percent}, this is still considerable and the decline continues [@Dunic2021]. The loss of seagrass meadows has also been observed in the Mediterranean [@delosSantos2019; @Dunic2021]. In fact, together with the Tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean experienced the greatest loss of seagrass meadows in absolute numbers, with the decline being greatest from the 1940s to the 1980s and the situation remaining stable thereafter [@Dunic2021]. A partially similar trend in the loss of seagrass meadows was also observed in the Adriatic Sea. After a sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, seagrass meadows experienced a phase of recovery in the 1990s. However, from 2007 to 2013 a further loss of seagrass meadows was recorded [@Danovaro2020]. Although @Short2011 estimated a stable population trend for *C. nodosa*, a more recent study using ecological niche modelling predicts, in the worst-case scenario, a sharp decline in suitable habitats for this species due to climate change [@Chefaoui2018]. Indeed, several studies reported the decline of *C. nodosa* meadows in different parts of the Mediterranean [@Barsanti2007; @Boudouresque2009; @Perez-Ruzafa2006; @Shili2002], including the Adriatic Sea [@Green2003; @Orlando-Bonaca2015; @Orlando-Bonaca2019].

## Microbial communities in sediments of seagrass meadows

Sediments of seagrass meadows are considered hotspots for microbial activity because, as already mentioned, these habitats are enriched with organic matter directly by seagrasses or through various seagrass-mediated processes [@Duarte2005\; Section \@ref(section-seagrasses)]. Consequently, studies have shown that microbial abundance, activity, and metabolic diversity are higher in seagrass-vegetated than in nonvegetated sediments [@Delille1996; @Duarte2005; @Holmer1997; @Mohapatra2022; @Smith2004]. The high organic matter content of seagrass sediments appears to stimulate the proliferation of sulphate-reducing bacteria, which in turn play an important role in the remineralisation of nutrients in these habitats [@Blackburn1994; @Duarte2005; @Holmer1997; @Smith2004]. This is consistent with the already recognised importance of sulphate reduction in the mineralisation of organic carbon in coastal sediments [@Jorgensen1982; @Jorgensen2019]. In addition, the facilitated release and transformation of nutrients by microbes during remineralisation supports seagrass growth and photosynthesis [@Duarte2005]. However, high rates of sulphate reduction can lead to the accumulation of hydrogen sulphide (\ch{H2S}), a potent phytotoxin [@Duarte2005; @Holmer2001a; @Koch2001], which has been linked to die-off events of seagrass meadows [@Borum2005; @Carlson1994]. The diffusion of oxygen from seagrass roots and the reoxidation of hydrogen sulphide back to sulphate has been recognised as a coping mechanism of seagrasses against hydrogen sulphide toxicity [@Duarte2005; @Hasler-Sheetal2015; @Holmer2005; @Pedersen2004]. These examples show that seagrasses and sediment microbes live in a state of delicate balance. For the growth and development of seagrasses, it is important that the positive, mutualistic effects of the microbes, such as the remineralisation of nutrients, overcome the negative ones, such as the production of hydrogen sulphide [@Duarte2005].

The composition of microbial communities living in sediments colonised by seagrasses is not as well studied, as research has mainly focused on the rhizosphere and only occasionally sediment communities have been used for comparison. It has been shown that communities in the rhizosphere are not species-specific and differ from those in the sediment [@Cucio2016; @Ettinger2017; @Rabbani2021; @Zhang2020]. One of the most important differences observed is the higher proportion of *Deltaproteobacteria* (reclassified as phylum *Desulfobacterota*) in the bulk sediment, a group that contains many sulphate reducers from marine sediments [@Ettinger2017; @Waite2020]. In contrast, the rhizosphere is characterised by members of the *Epsilonproteobacteria* [reclassified as phylum *Campylobacterota*\; @Ettinger2017; @Jensen2007; @Waite2017; @Waite2018]. Microbial communities in sediments colonised by many seagrass species such as *Enhalus acoroides* (Linnaeus f.) Royle, *Thalassia hemprichii* (Ehrenberg) Ascherson [@Liu2018], *Thalassia testudinum* K. D. Koenig [@Ugarelli2024], *Amphibolis antarctica* (Labillardière) Ascherson, *Halodule uninervis* (Forsskål) Ascherson [@Fraser2018], *Halodule wrightii* Ascherson [@Smith2004], *Posidonia oceanica* [@Garcia-Martinez2009], *Nanozostera japonica* (Ascherson et Graebner) Tomlinson et Posluszny, and *Zostera marina* [@Sun2020] have been described [@Guiry2025]. Studies have often found differences between seagrass-vegetated and nonvegetated areas [@Alsaffar2020; @Smith2004; @Sun2020; @Zheng2019]. Furthermore, differences in microbial communities have been described even between the periphery and the central region of the seagrass meadow [@Ettinger2017]. One of the differences between seagrass-vegetated and nonvegetated areas is the higher abundance of archaea in seagrass-colonised sediments [@Zheng2019]. The archaeal community in seagrass sediments generally includes *Crenarchaeota*, *Euryarchaeota*, *Asgardaeota*, *Woesearchaeota*, *Bathyarchaeota*, and *Thaumarchaeota* [@Sun2020; @Zheng2019], while the bacterial community consists predominantly of *Proteobacteria*, *Chloroflexi*, *Planctomycetes*, *Bacteroidetes*, *Acidobacteria*, *Epsilonproteobacteria* (reclassified as phylum *Campylobacterota*), and *Latescibacteria* [@Sun2020; @Waite2017; @Waite2018].
