#### Compile the PDF
The PDF of the doctoral thesis can be compiled on a Linux computer by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/MicrobesRovinj/Markovski_DoctoralThesis_2025.git
cd Markovski_DoctoralThesis_2025/
R -e "render_book(input = 'index.Rmd')"
```
Alternatively, the last command can be replaced by opening the `project_file.Rproj` in RStudio IDE and clicking *Build Book* in the Build Pane.
