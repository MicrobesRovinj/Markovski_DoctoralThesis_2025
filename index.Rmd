The presence of seagrass in marine environments influences surface sediments and creates specific environmental conditions that support diverse and abundant sediment microbial communities. However, the decline of seagrass meadows of various species has been documented worldwide, including that of *Cymodocea nodosa*, a common seagrass species in the Mediterranean Sea. In the Bay of Saline, located in the northern Adriatic Sea, a decline of a *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow was observed during its monthly status assessment from July 2017 to October 2018. To determine the response of sediment microbes to seagrass meadow decline, surface sediments were collected from two sites during that period, one without vegetation and one with the declining seagrass meadow. The microbial response was assessed by determining community composition and metabolic profile. In addition, the environmental conditions in the sediment were assessed and changes after the onset of meadow decline were detected, such as an accumulation of hydrogen sulphide. Despite these changes, no clear temporal succession of the microbial community in the sediment was observed. Instead, the communities were stratified by sediment depth and exhibited distinct community composition between sites. The bacterial community was mainly comprised of *Desulfobacterota*, *Gammaproteobacteria*, *Bacteroidota*, *Chloroflexi*, *Planctomycetota*, and *Campylobacterota*, while the archaeal community was dominated by *Nanoarchaeota*, *Thermoplasmatota*, *Crenarchaeota*, and *Asgardarchaeota*. Functional analysis based on microbial profiles revealed that these communities degrade complex sugars and proteins, producing acetate, formate, and ethanol by fermentation, thereby supporting dissimilatory sulphate reduction. Before the seagrass decline, notable differences in the metabolic profiles were observed between sites. However, during the decline, the profiles converged, with those of the nonvegetated site resembling the ones of the *Cymodocea nodosa* meadow sediment. These results indicate that while the microbial communities in the seagrass meadow sediments remain stable in composition and function during the decline, adjacent communities shift their metabolic profiles, highlighting the broader ecological influence of the decline of seagrass meadows.

```
Prisutnost morskih cvjetnica u morskom okolišu utječe na površinske sedimente stvarajući specifične uvjete pogodne za raznolike mikrobne zajednice velikih brojnosti. No, širom svijeta zabilježeno je propadanje livada morskih cvjetnica raznih vrsta, uključujući livade vrste *Cymodocea nodosa*, česte morske cvjetnice u Sredozemnom moru. Propadanje livade ove vrste utvrđeno je i u uvali Saline, smještenoj u sjevernom Jadranskom moru, tijekom redovitog postupka procjene stanja livade morske cvjetnice provedenog od srpnja 2017. do listopada 2018. Tijekom ovog razdoblja uzorkovan je površinski sediment na dvije postaje, jednoj bez vegetacije i jednoj s propadajućom livadom, kako bi se odredio odgovor mikrobnih zajednica sedimenta na propadanje livade morske cvjetnice. Odgovor mikrobnih zajednica utvrđen je određivanjem njihovog sastava i metaboličkog profila. Također, određeni su uvjeti okoliša u sedimentu te su zabilježene promjene uvjeta nakon početka propadanja livade, poput nakupljanja sumporovodika. Unatoč ovim promjenama, nije utvrđena jasna vremenska sukcesija mikrobne zajednice sedimenta. Umjesto toga, uočene su promjene u sastavu zajednica u odnosu na dubinu sedimenta i između postaja. Bakterijsku zajednicu činila su prvenstveno koljena *Desulfobacterota*, *Bacteroidota*, *Chloroflexi*, *Planctomycetota* i *Campylobacterota* te razred *Gammaproteobacteria*, dok su zajednicom arheja prevladavala koljena *Nanoarchaeota*, *Thermoplasmatota*, *Crenarchaeota* i *Asgardarchaeota*. Funkcionalna analiza temeljena na mikrobnim profilima otkrila je da ove zajednice razgrađuju složene šećere i proteine proizvodeći acetat, format i etanol fermentacijom, čime podržavaju disimilatornu redukciju sulfata. Prije propadanja livade uočene su primjetne razlike između postaja u metaboličkim profilima. Međutim, metabolički su profili tijekom propadanja postali vrlo slični, pri čemu su profili nevegetirane postaje počeli nalikovati sedimentu s vrstom *Cymodocea nodosa*. Ovi rezultati ukazuju da, iako sastav i funkcija mikrobnih zajednica u sedimentu livade morske cvjetnice ostaju nepromijenjeni tijekom propadanja, okolne zajednice pokazuju promjene metaboličkog profila naglašavajući širi ekološki utjecaj propadanja livada morskih cvjetnica.

## PROŠIRENI SAŽETAK (EXTENDED ABSTRACT) {.unlisted .unnumbered #prosireni-sazetak-extended-abstract}

Morske cvjetnice nastanjuju i oblikuju plitka obalna sedimentna dna [@Duarte2002]. Njihove livade pohranjuju i time uklanjaju ugljik iz okoliša, čineći ove ekosustave važnim dionicima ublažavanja klimatskih promjena [@Duarte2005a; @Duarte2013; @Kennedy2010]. Međutim, zbog sve veće izloženosti antropogenim pritiscima uočen je gubitak livada morskih cvjetnica na globalnoj razini [@Dunic2021; @Orth2006; @Waycott2009]. Prisutnost ovih biljaka u obalnim sedimentima stvara specifične uvjete okoliša koji podržavaju veliki broj stanica raznolikih i aktivnih mikrobnih zajednica [@Duarte2005]. Većina istraživanja mikrobnih zajednica morskih cvjetnica vezana je za epifite i rizosferu [@Cucio2016; @Korlevic2021], dok su istraživanja zajednica u sedimentima rijetka. Posljedično su i saznanja o dinamici i utjecaju livade na mikrobne zajednice u sedimentima ograničena. U ovom okolišu, mikrobne zajednice pospješuju oslobađanje i transformaciju nutrijenata tijekom razgradnje organske tvari, podržavajući time rast i primarnu produkciju biljaka. Osim ovakvih povoljnih učinaka, mikrobna aktivnost može imati i negativnih utjecaja na biljke, poput oslobađanja sumporovodika uslijed visokih stopa redukcije sulfata [@Duarte2005]. Za rast i razvoj morskih cvjetnica bitno je da povoljni učinci mikrobne aktivnosti, poput oslobađanja i transformacije nutrijenata, nadvladavaju nepovoljne, kao što je proizvodnja sumporovodika [@Duarte2005]. Prisutnost livada morskih cvjetnica i mikrobna remineralizacija organske tvari u sedimentu bitni su čimbenici u biogeokemijskom ciklusu ugljika [@Duarte2005; @Duarte2005a]. Zbog navedenog, važno je unaprijediti razumijevanje međudjelovanja morskih cvjetnica i svih njihovih mikrobnih zajednica.

Morska cvjetnica *Cymodocea nodosa* rasprostranjena je širom Sredozemnog mora [@Green2003; @Short2007]. U skladu s podacima o propadanju livada morskih cvjetnica širom svijeta uočeno je i propadanje livada vrste *Cymodocea nodosa* u raznim obalnim područjima [@Barsanti2007; @Boudouresque2009; @Perez-Ruzafa2006; @Shili2002], uključujući i sjeverno Jadransko more [@Green2003; @Orlando-Bonaca2015; @Orlando-Bonaca2019]. Zbog gubitka ovih vrijednih staništa te ograničenih saznanja o mikrobnim zajednicama sedimenata morskih cvjetnica, cilj istraživanja bio je utvrditi sastav i raznolikost mikrobnih zajednica u sedimentu livade vrste *Cymodocea nodosa* primjenom sekvenciranja markerskog gena te odrediti funkcionalnu raznolikost i dinamiku zajednica zajedničkom primjenom metoda metagenomike i metaproteomike.

Mjesečno uzorkovanje vrste *Cymodocea nodosa*, vodenog stupca i sedimenta provedeno je u uvali Saline, smještenoj sjeverozapadno od Rovinja, u sjevernom Jadranskom moru, u razdoblju od srpnja 2017. do listopada 2018. Procjena stanja ove morske cvjetnice obavljena je uzorkovanjem unutar livade metodom probnih kvadrata te biometrijskom analizom izdanaka i rizoma s korijenjem. Uzorci jezgara površinskog sedimenta prikupljeni su na dvije postaje, jednoj bez vegetacije i jednoj koja je na početku uzorkovanja sadržavala livadu vrste *Cymodocea nodosa*. Kako bi se utvrdila dinamika uvjeta u okolišu, određen je niz fizikalno-kemijskih parametara u vodenom stupcu i u prikupljenim jezgrama sedimenta. Prije izdvajanja DNA i proteina, svaka je jezgra sedimenta izrezana u četiri odsječka visine 1 \si{\cm}. Izdvajanje ukupne DNA provedeno je primjenom smjese organskih otapala prema @Zhou1996, uz modifikacije koje su opisali @Pjevac2018. Sastav i raznolikost mikrobne zajednice utvrđeni su sekvenciranjem regije V4 gena za 16S rRNA platformom Illumina MiSeq, dok su funkcionalna raznolikost i dinamika zajednica određene iz metaboličkih profila, proizašlih iz zajedničke analize metagenoma i metaproteoma. Metagenomi su sekvencirani analizom ukupne DNA iz odabranih uzoraka platformom Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Ukupni su proteini izdvojeni izravnom lizom mikrobnih stanica inkubacijom sedimenta u lužnatom puferu s visokom koncentracijom natrijevog dodecilsulfata i naknadnim taloženjem s trikloroctenom kiselinom [@Chourey2010]. Sastav metaproteoma, te posljedično i metabolički profil zajednica, određeni su primjenom tandemske masene spektrometrije te identifikacijom proteina usporedbom dobivenih masenih spektara s aminokiselinskim sljedovima proizašlim iz analize metagenoma.

Na početku istraživanja, uvalu Saline naseljavala je morska cvjetnica vrste *Cymodocea nodosa*, čija se prostrana livada protezala od jugozapadnog dijela uvale, dubine 1,5 \si{\m}, prema središnjem dijelu, dubine 4 \si{\m}. Na kraju istraživanja, preostalo je svega nekoliko vrlo malih područja naseljenih s vrstom *Cymodocea nodosa*, uz samu obalu u obliku uskih pruga. Biometrijska analiza ukazala je na normalan ciklus rasta izdanaka i rizoma s korijenjem od srpnja 2017. do ožujka 2018. Najviše vrijednosti biometrijskih parametara izdanaka zabilježene su u listopadu 2017., nakon čega je, u studenom 2017., utvrđen snažan pad vrijednosti, u skladu s uobičajenim smanjenim rastom morske cvjetnice zimi [@Agostini2003; @Cancemi2002; @Najdek2020a; @Terrados1992; @Zavodnik1998]. Međutim, na proljeće 2018., izostao je ponovni rast morske cvjetnice i oporavak livade. Za razliku od izdanaka, biomasa rizoma s korijenjem bila je stabilna do ožujka 2018., kada je uočen njezin pad, koji se nastavio do kraja istraživanja, u skladu s uočenim propadanjem livade. Proces propadanja najvjerojatnije je potaknulo smanjenje dostupnosti svjetla, i posljedično pad fotosintetske aktivnosti, zbog povećane mutnoće mora uzrokovane snažnijim terigenim donosom i resuspenzijom sedimenta. Na snažniji terigeni donos upućivalo je smanjenje saliniteta i povećanje koncentracije partikularne tvari u vodenom stupcu. Pad fotosintetske aktivnosti prouzročio je i pad oksidacijske sposobnosti korijenja, bitnog mehanizama zaštite morske cvjetnice od toksičnog djelovanja sumporovodika. Naime, nakon početka propadanja livade, zabilježeno je povećanje koncentracije i proširenje zone nakupljanja sumporovodika.

Iako su se uvjeti okoliša u sedimentu tijekom istraživanog razdoblja, u kojem je zabilježeno i propadanje livade, mijenjali, analiza raznolikosti zasnovana na sekvenciranju markerskog gena nije otkrila jasnu vremensku sukcesiju mikrobne zajednice sedimenta. Umjesto toga, zabilježene su razlike u zajednicama u odnosu na dubinu sedimenta te između postaje bez vegetacije i postaje koja je na početku istraživanja sadržavala livadu morske cvjetnice. Taksonomska analiza sastava mikrobnih zajednica otkrila je prevladavanje nukleotidnih sljedova domene *Bacteria* nad onima domene *Archaea*. Bakterijsku zajednicu činila su prvenstveno koljena *Desulfobacterota*, *Bacteroidota*, *Chloroflexi*, *Planctomycetota* i *Campylobacterota* te razred *Gammaproteobacteria*, dok su zajednicom arheja prevladavala koljena *Nanoarchaeota*, *Thermoplasmatota*, *Crenarchaeota* i *Asgardarchaeota*. Analizom dinamike taksonomskih skupina utvrđen je pad udjela s dubinom sedimenta domene *Bacteria*, koljena *Bacteroidota* i razreda *Gammaproteobacteria*, dok je za domenu *Archaea* te koljena *Chloroflexi* i *Thermoplasmatota* uočen suprotni trend rasta. Nadalje, udio koljena *Bacteroidota* i *Campylobacterota* bio je veći na postaji koja je na početku istraživanja sadržavala livadu, za razliku od koljena *Crenarchaeota* i razreda *Gammaproteobacteria*, čiji je udio bio veći na postaji bez vegetacije. Uočena vremenska stabilnost zajednica tijekom propadanja livade upućivala je na potrebu provjere odražavanja ovog obrasca i u funkcionalnoj raznolikosti i dinamici mikrobnih zajednica sedimenta.

Metabolički profili mikrobnih zajednica, proizašli iz zajedničke analize metagenoma i metaproteoma, su za razliku od sastava i raznolikosti zajednica ukazali na promjene tijekom propadanja livade. Prije početka propadanja, uočene su razlike u bogatstvu i indeksu raznolikosti proteina između postaje bez vegetacije i postaje s livadom morske cvjetnice. Ove su razlike bile izraženije u dubljim slojevima sedimenta. Tijekom propadanja, bogatstvo i indeksi raznolikosti proteina u sedimentu bez vegetacije postali su slični onima u sedimentu s propadajućom livadom, dok u samom sedimentu s propadajućom livadom nisu uočene vremenske promjene ovih parametara. U skladu s ovim podacima, vremenske promjene strukture metaboličkog profila uočene su isključivo na postaji bez vegetacije te su, također, bile izraženije u dubljim slojevima sedimenta.

Metaboličkim su profilima mikrobnih zajednica prevladavali proteini vezani uz proizvodnju i pretvorbu energije. Kako bi se utvrdio sastav proteina uključenih u razgradnju organske tvari i njihov odgovor na propadanje livade, praćena je dinamika hidrolitičkih enzima, ABC-transportera (engl. *\underline{A}TP-\underline{b}inding \underline{c}assette*), enzima vezanih za razne fermentacijske procese te proteina uključenih u disimilatornu redukciju sulfata. Među hidrolitičkim enzimima najzastupljeniji su bili enzimi za razgradnju ugljikohidrata i proteina. To je bilo u skladu s prisutnošću ABC-transportera, od kojih su najzastupljeniji bili specifični za šećere i aminokiseline, što naglašava važnost ugljikohidrata i proteina za mikrobnu zajednicu u sedimentu. Analiza enzima vezanih za razne fermentacijske procese otkrila je najveću zastupljenost proteina uključenih u fermentaciju acetata, formata i etanola, važnih fermentacijskih produkata u morskim sedimentima. Među proteinima za proizvodnju i pretvorbu energije, jedni od najzastupljenijih bili su enzimi uključeni u disimilatornu redukciju sulfata, odražavajući važnost ovog procesa za mineralizaciju organske tvari u morskim sedimentima. Tijekom propadanja livade, dinamika ABC-transportera, enzima vezanih za fermentacijske procese te proteina uključenih u disimilatornu redukciju sulfata uglavnom je pratila već opisane promjene cjelokupnog metaboličkog profila.

Rezultati istraživanja sastava zajednica u sedimentu morske cvjetnice *Cymodocea nodosa* upotpunjuju opis mikrobnih zajednica povezanih s ovom važnom morskom cvjetnicom Sredozemnog mora. Također, zajednička primjena metoda metagenomike i metaproteomike u određivanju metaboličkog profila zajednica čini iskorak u istraživanju, ne samo mikrobnih zajednica sedimenta morskih cvjetnica, već i općenito zajednica površinskog obalnog sedimenta. Praćenje stanja morske cvjetnice *Cymodocea nodosa* u uvali Saline, tijekom kojeg je zabilježeno propadanje livade, te određivanje sastava i funkcije mikrobnih zajednica u sedimentu pružilo je posebnu priliku za istraživanje odgovora zajednica na propadanje livade morske cvjetnice. Zaključno, rezultati ukazuju na izostanak utjecaja propadanja livade na sastav mikrobnih zajednica sedimenta. Međutim, funkcionalna analiza utvrdila je promjene metaboličkog profila zajednica tijekom propadanja livade, isključivo u okolnom sedimentu bez vegetacije i s izraženijim promjenama u dubljim slojevima sedimenta.
